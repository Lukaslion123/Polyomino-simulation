POLYOMINO SIMULATION
Just a fun little project, testing my abilities.
WHAT DOES IT DO?
It will generate arrays of n-omino grid coordinates and those will be then used to run a set rule simulation with True and False values modifying each other in the space of the n-ominoes. Results will be stored in a database.
WARNING
I am neither a good coder nor do i have experience in writng readmes.
Feel free to provide any feedback.
